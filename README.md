I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in University College Dublin.
See my webpage https://maths.ucd.ie/~mst for more information on my research, teaching, etc. 

My primary research interest is in population genetics, with a focus on human genomes. 
I work with collaborators in biology and genetics on human, animal, and bacterial genetics. 

My other focus is on social network analysis. I build and assess novel statistical models for networks of wild animals. 
These can be used to discover and summarise the network, find communities, predict disease outbreaks, etc. 
I'm particularly interested in the robustness and computational challenges involved in fitting such models. 

I'm active in several other areas of applied computational statistics, including palaeoclimate reconstruction.
